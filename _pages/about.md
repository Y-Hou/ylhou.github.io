I am a PhD student at the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.nus.edu.sg), [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg), and I am previleged to be supervised by Prof. [Vincent Y. F. Tan](https://vyftan.github.io/index.html). 
Previously, I received my BS in Mathematics from [Beijing Normal University](https://english.bnu.edu.cn), advised by Prof. Huajie Chen and Prof. Shihua Zhang.

Research
===
I am broadly interersted in both the theoretical limits and emprical applications of reinforcement learning and online learning (e.g., multi-armed bandits), with current emphasis on theoretically-guaranteed algorithmic design in Large Language Models.


<h3 class="nus-blue">Theoretically-grounded Applications of Reinforcement Learning</h3>
- Development of *practical* and *provably* sound reinforcement learning methods for decision-making during model training and deployment.

<h3 class="nus-blue">Reinforcement Learning and Bandit Algorithm Design and Theory</h3>
- Characterization of theoretical limits of decision making under practical modeling assumptions (e.g., stationary v.s. non-stationary, single- v.s. multi-agent), possibly subject to realistic constraints (e.g., efficiency or risk requirements).
- Design of provable algorithms that approach the fundamental performance limits.
